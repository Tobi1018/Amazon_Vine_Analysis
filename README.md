## Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

Using my knowledge of the cloud ETL process, I created an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin,  I make use of a dataset from the [Amazon Review datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Digital_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz) and extract the dataset into a DataFrame. Then, transform the DataFrame into four separate DataFrames that match the table schema in pgAdmin. Then, I upload the transformed data into the appropriate tables and run queries in pgAdmin to confirm that the data has been uploaded.
